    "title": "Enhancing Image Retrieval Through Optimal Barcode Representation",
    "description": "This repository contains the implementation of deep feature barcoding methods using Combinatorial Genetic Algorithm (CGA) for efficient medical image retrieval. The code includes multiple hashing and barcoding techniques evaluated on TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) datasets and other image datasets. The main contribution is the optimization of feature ordering using CGA to improve barcoding performance for histopathological image retrieval. This implementation includes: 1) Combinatorial Genetic Algorithm for feature ordering optimization, 2) Multiple baseline hashing methods (aHash, dHash, DFT, etc.), 3) Neural network-based hashing approaches, 4) Comprehensive evaluation metrics (F1-score, Precision@k, mAP), 5) Support for multiple datasets including TCGA organ-specific subsets.",
